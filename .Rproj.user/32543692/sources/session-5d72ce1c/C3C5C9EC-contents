# **1. Introduction**

This study provides a recent historical perspective aimed at better understanding the diversification processes of organisms in the northern Andean páramos, a high-mountain ecosystem that has been significantly influenced by geological and climatic events during the Pleistocene. During this time, climatic fluctuations generated complex dynamics of connectivity among the páramo fragments, which are hypothesized to have affected the distribution and divergence of species inhabiting these ecosystems. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether there is a relationship between evolutionary divergence and historical connectivity during the Pleistocene, aiming to identify which aspects of this connectivity are important in the speciation process. To achieve this, we integrate paleoclimatic modeling of the páramo boundaries over the last 2 million years with the evolutionary history of a complex of frailejones (subtribe Espeletiinae) as a biological model.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **1.2 Context**

Three key processes shape divergence during speciation: gene flow, selection, and genetic drift. Gene flow and drift are profoundly influenced by the spatial configuration of the habitat, while selection depends on the local biotic and abiotic environment. These processes are believed to have a more pronounced impact in the early stages of speciation, before prezygotic barriers are established, which interrupt gene flow between lineages. Having a habitat distribution model spanning a considerable time interval where speciation events can occur provides an ideal opportunity to test this theoretical framework.

Frailejones are plants closely tied to the climate, occurring exclusively at high elevations where arboreal plants are absent. Their evolution has been shaped by the spatial dynamics of the páramo during the Pleistocene, a period during which many of their current species originated.

This study represents a first attempt to quantify the effect of habitat spatial configuration over time, evaluating how historical connectivity and area size have influenced gene flow and genetic drift during the speciation process.

What time intervals and conditions are crucial for speciation? This is a fascinating question that has captured the interest of many researchers. However, the resources needed to address this question are limited. Therefore, this scenario provides an excellent opportunity to examine how spatial configuration over time can shed light on diversification processes.

# **2. Methodology**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **2.1 Geographic Connectivity Models**

The study began with the development of geographic connectivity models, based on the paleoclimatic model proposed by Flantua et al. (2019). This model describes the fluctuations of the Upper Forest Line (UFL) over ≈2 million years, allowing us to assess how these changes affected connectivity between the páramo fragments in the Andes.

    > [**Development of the Movement Cost Matrix:**](https://github.com/innerhaze/DEM-Reclassification-R-Paramo-Connectivity-Modeling) A cost raster was constructed using a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) encompassing all páramo areas in the northern Andes. Specific movement costs were assigned to different altitudinal zones, reflecting the limited dispersal capacity of páramo organisms. The movement cost gradually increases as one moves away from the páramo core, reflecting the difficulties faced by species when dispersing between isolated fragments.

    > [**Calculation of Connectivity Metrics:**](https://github.com/innerhaze/Java-R-Integration-with-Graphab-Cost-Surface-Processing-and-Data-Management) Using the Graphab software, various connectivity metrics were calculated, including Least-Cost Distance (LCD) and the Current Flow (CF) index. These metrics were determined for 19 distinct páramo configurations, derived from the Pleistocene climatic fluctuations according to the Flantua et al. (2019) model. These calculations are crucial for understanding how climatic fluctuations influenced connectivity between the patches representing the distribution of each species included in the Espeletiinae phylogeny developed by Diazgranados and Barber (2017).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **2.2 Phylogenetic Methods**

With the connectivity models established, we proceeded to construct an ultrametric phylogeny of Espeletiinae. DNA sequence data from the ETS, ITS, and rpl16 genes, obtained from previous studies by Diazgranados and Barber (2017), were used. These sequences were concatenated, and the IQ-TREE software was used to build the phylogeny based on the GTR+I+G model. The tree was calibrated considering key historical events, such as the divergence between Espeletiinae clades in Venezuela and Colombia, placing the crown of the tree at approximately 2.3 million years, following the methodology of Pouchon et al. (2021).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **2.3 Historical Connectivity Algorithm**

An algorithm developed in R was used to integrate the information from the connectivity models and the phylogeny. This algorithm weights connectivity metrics based on the duration of each páramo configuration during the time interval between parent and child nodes in the phylogeny. This interval is selected to represent the period during which, hypothetically, the Pleistocene climatic fluctuations would have influenced connectivity, increasing or decreasing isolation between species. Once these key times were established, the algorithm queries the Flantua et al. (2019) paleoclimatic model database to obtain the páramo configurations and their duration during these intervals. With this information, a weighted average is calculated that reflects historical connectivity for each pair of phylogenetic combinations, ensuring that the critical divergence periods between species are appropriately considered in the analysis, provided these times do not exceed 2.2 million years, the time range covered by the paleoclimatic model.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **2.4 Generalized Dissimilarity Model (GDM)**

After generating the historical connectivity data from the designed algorithm, a Generalized Dissimilarity Model (GDM) was used to assess the relationship between historical connectivity and evolutionary divergence in Espeletiinae. The GDM allowed us to analyze how the historical connectivity metrics, calculated based on páramo configurations during the Pleistocene, correlate with the evolutionary distances between lineages. Visit the following [link](https://github.com/innerhaze/Generalized-Dissimilarity-Modeling-for-Evolutionary-Divergence-and-Historical-Connectivity-Analysis) for more details.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# **3. Main Results**

The results indicate that geographic connectivity during the Pleistocene had a significant impact on the evolutionary divergence of Espeletiinae. In particular, historical connectivity emerged as a key explanatory variable for evolutionary distances when the patches (occurrence sites) were farther apart. In contrast, when the patches were closer together, Euclidean distance proved to be a more determining factor.

# **4. Methodological Issues and Challenges**

Below are some issues and challenges to address within the methodological aspects:

1.  <div>

    > **Temporal occurrence data:** The occurrence of each lineage in the landscape is based on current data. Therefore, connectivity calculations are made based on the present distribution, as no precise information is available on the historical location of these organisms. This is clearly illustrated in figure 2 of this [link](https://innerhaze.github.io/R-Algorithm-for-Historical-Connectivity-Analysis-of-Paramo-Lineages-in-the-Pleistocene/)

    <div>

2.  <div>

    > **Complexity in measuring connectivity:** When species occur within the same patch, measuring connectivity in Graphab becomes complicated. This is because two or more species, when located in adjacent occurrence points, are treated as a single patch unit, complicating measurements intended to be made between species pairs.

    </div>

3.  <div>

    > **Temporal limitations in phylogenetic studies:** Phylogenies studied using this method cannot exceed 2.2 million years in their study times, as this is the maximum data range available in the pollen column used.
